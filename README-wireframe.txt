Features
-Providing information to immigrants. Below are the categories
  of information that a user can select from: 
1. Places of Interest
2. Calgary Information
3. Events
4. Useful Links

How to navigate
From the Home Screen, user can select one of 3 different buttons,
which are Places of Interest, Calgary Information, and Events. Each
of these three sections has their own internal menu systems, consisting
primarily of buttons and drop-down lists.

-Places of Interest
	This page is intended to contain a directory of useful locations for
  immigrants, but is also a decent guide for anyone else using it. In this
  bare-bones version, only Restaurants is selectable, and shows a rudimentary
  interface we might use in the final version.
-Calgary Information
  This page contains further information about Calgary, including 
  buttons such as History, Culture, Sports, and the Top 10 Facts about
  Calgary. The only interactive button in this version is the Sports page;
  the other pages will be selectable, and have a great deal more information,
  in future prototype versions where it is appropriate.
-Events
  This page contains the option of searching for events by filtering them by 
  culture or by area. Once a selection has been made, it will display information
  of the events by the appropriate filtering. The events will contain a description,
  a location and time. In this prototype, Culture inputs are assumed to be Chinese, and
  Area inputs are assumed as Acadia; further improvements will be made for future versions.
