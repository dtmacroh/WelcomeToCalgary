Features
-Provides details on events open to immigrants to Calgary
-Filter these events based on
   Culture
   City Quadrant
   Primary age group
   Display only free events
-Prompt the user to print a copy of the event (currently only available through WoZ technology)

How to navigate
From the Home Screen (with updated animations), users have only two applicable buttons open
to them: Home, and Socializing and Events. By clicking on Socializing and Events, users
will change to a page that displays a list of upcoming events, as well as a 'Filters' panel
which has the following options:

-By Area. Displays a map of the quadrants of the city (more detailed map would require
 more research/time commitment), and by selecting one will force the list to show only
 events from that quadrant of the city
 
-By Culture. Displays a selection listing of continents (company-based culture list would
 require more research/time commitment), and by selecting one will force the list to show
 only events conforming to cultures from that continent
 
-By Age. Displays a selection listing of ages (Child, Teen, Young Adult, Adult, Senior), and
 selecting one will narrow the list down to show only events having that primary age group
 
-Show Free Events Only. Selecting this option will only show the events which have no
 cost associated with admission or participation
 
Each event also has an associated Print This Event button. This will pull up a prompt suggesting
the event has been printed. This has been implemented for use in Wizard of Oz demonstrations.
