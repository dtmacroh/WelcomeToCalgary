Group name: DD&J
Group Members: Daniel Armstrong, Debbie Macrohon & Joanna Huynh
Project name: Welcome to Calgary

This is a prototype relating our project, Welcome to Calgary.
Listed below is the instructions on how to run it, as well as 
the features our system offers.

Instructions 
1. Open DONOTDELETE - New Project Attempt directory
2. Open WelcomeToCalgary directory
3. Select and run the file WelcometoCalgary.sln (Microsoft Visual Studio solution)
4. Run the application.

Scenario:
Our scenario would be an immigrant wanting to find more information about Calgary, events taking place or places of interest.

Demo Script:
An athletic immigrant is curious about the sports in Calgary, he opens up the Calgary kiosk app and is presented with a homepage with four main sections; places of interest, Calgary information, events and useful links. Since he wants to learn about sports in Calgary, he’ll select the Calgary information button. Which will result in a selection of categories; history, sports, culture and top 10 facts. He will select the sports button and information about hockey will be displayed. He is fascinated by this sport and selects the events button on the navigation bar offered at the top of the application to check if there are any hockey events. He decides to search by area and there aren’t any hockey events offered in his area. Hence, he decides to click on the places of interest button on the navigation bar. He selects the sports category and discovers information about the Saddledome and the games held in the building. 


Features
-Providing information to immigrants. Below are the categories
  of information that a user can select from: 
1. Places of Interest
2. Calgary Information
3. Events
4. Useful Links

How to navigate
From the Home Screen, user can select one of 4 different buttons,
which are Places of Interest, Calgary Information, Events and 
Useful Links.

-Places of Interest
	This page is intended to contain a directory of useful locations for
  immigrants, but is also a decent guide for anyone else using it. Each
  button in the menu leads to a different directory of entries; in a more
  complete prototype, there would be further filtering available beyond here.
  
-Calgary Information
  This page contains further information about Calgary, including 
  buttons such as History, Culture, Sports, and the Top 10 Facts about
  Calgary. Each button will lead to information relating to its 
  respective name. 
-Events
  This page contains the option of searching for events by filtering them by 
  culture or by area. Once a selection has been made, it will display information
  of the events by the appropriate filtering. The events will contain a description,
  a location and time.
 
-Useful Links
  This page will serve to hold links or standalone executable files which
  would not fit within our assignment scope. The current example link is
  for the Calgary Transit website, which was originally intended for
  inclusion but broke our scope. Links currently do not work, and will be
  fixed if revisited in future prototypes
