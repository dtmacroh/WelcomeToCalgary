README - Horizontal Prototype

Group name: DD&J
Project name: Welcome to Calgary

This is a prototype relating our project, Welcome to Calgary.
Listed below is the instructions on how to run it, as well as 
the features our system offers.

Instructions 
1. Open DONOTDELETE - New Project Attempt directory
2. Open WelcomeToCalgary directory
3. Select and run the file WelcometoCalgary.sln (Microsoft Visual Studio solution)
4. Run the application.

Features
-Providing information to immigrants. Below are the categories
  of information that a user can select from: 
1. Places of Interest
2. Calgary Information
3. Events
4. Useful Links

How to navigate
From the Home Screen, user can select one of 4 different buttons,
which are Places of Interest, Calgary Information, Events and 
Useful Links.

-Places of Interest
	This page is intended to contain a directory of useful locations for
  immigrants, but is also a decent guide for anyone else using it. Each
  button in the menu leads to a different directory of entries; in a more
  complete prototype, there would be further filtering available beyond here.
  
-Calgary Information
  This page contains further information about Calgary, including 
  buttons such as History, Culture, Sports, and the Top 10 Facts about
  Calgary. Each button will lead to information relating to its 
  respective name. 
-Events
  This page contains the option of searching for events by filtering them by 
  culture or by area. Once a selection has been made, it will display information
  of the events by the appropriate filtering. The events will contain a description,
  a location and time.
 
-Useful Links
  This page will serve to hold links or standalone executable files which
  would not fit within our assignment scope. The current example link is
  for the Calgary Transit website, which was originally intended for
  inclusion but broke our scope. Links currently do not work, and will be
  fixed if revisited in future prototypes
